Determines if there is a loop in the given link. Returns true if there is a loop, otherwise returns false.


Data range: length of the link 0≤n≤10000, the value of any node in the link satisfies ∣val∣<=100000
Requirements: space complexity O(1), time complexity O(n)

The input is divided into two parts, the first part is a link, the second part represents whether there is a loop, 
and then the head node of the composition is passed into the function. -1 represents no loop, the other numbers represent a loop, 
these parameters are explained only to facilitate the reader to self-test debugging. 
The actual input in the programming is the head node of the link.

input：
{3,2,0,-4},1
return：
true
introduction：
第一部分{3,2,0,-4}代表一个链表，第二部分的1表示，-4到位置1（注：头结点为位置0），即-4->2存在一个链接，组成传入的head为一个带环的链表，返回true  
The first part {3,2,0,-4} represents a link, the second part of 1 means that -4 to position 1 
(note: the head node is position 0), that is, -4->2 there is a joint, 
the composition of the incoming head is a chain table with a loop, return true  

Input.
{1},-1
Return:
false
Description.
The first part {1} represents a link, -1 represents no-loop, 
composed by passing in head as a single link with no-loop, returns false

Input.
{-1,-7,7,-4,19,6,-9,-5,-2,-5},6
Return:
true
